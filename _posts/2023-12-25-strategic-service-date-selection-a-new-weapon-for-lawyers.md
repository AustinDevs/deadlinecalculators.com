# The Power of Choosing the Right Service Date

Just like in chess, success in the courtroom also depends on strategic moves made at the right time. One such strategy for lawyers involves the critical but often overlooked aspect of service date selection. Though it might seem as simple as a date stamped on a legal document, the chosen service date can significantly influence the entire course and the ultimate outcome of a case. 

## What is Service Date Selection?

In the legal world, the 'service date' refers to the specific day when an individual receives legal documents. These could be court summons, notice of proceedings, or other critical legal papers. While it might seem inconsequential, this humble date holds the power to trigger various court-mandated deadlines ensuing from it, in turn affecting case progress. 

# The Strategic Importance of Service Date

Imagine a legal situation where the defendant is known to go on vacation at certain times of the year, and the plaintiff, being aware of this, chooses to serve the notice right before the defendant's vacation. This strategic move could lead to a default judgment as the defendant might not respond due to absence. 

Now, such strategic selection of service dates can be a double-edged sword if not wielded properly. For example, unintentionally serving the notice just before holidays or weekends could inadvertently provide extra days to the opposing party to respond, owing to the non-business days. 

In both cases, strategic planning is key and that's where tools like DeadlineCalculators.com come into play.
