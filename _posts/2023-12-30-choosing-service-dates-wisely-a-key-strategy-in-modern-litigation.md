As we immerse ourselves more deeply into the intricacies of modern litigation, we realize a major point of leverage that is often overlooked: the choice of service dates. This seemingly small and to some extent, mundane decision, could be the key to gaining an upper hand in litigation.

To the unacquainted, a service date in legal contexts is simply when legal documents are delivered or "served" to a party. Every litigation process commences with this critical step. The timing of it, however, carries more weight than most realize. 

## The Strategic Importance of Service Dates

Selecting a service date is not a mere administrative task; it's a tactical move that can set the momentum of the litigation to your advantage. A well-chosen service date can provide ample time for case preparation, influence the scheduling of critical court dates, and consequently, the overall direction of the lawsuit.

Judges, for example, use the service date to calculate time for other steps in the litigation process such as when responses should be filed or when objections need to be submitted. A strategic choice of service date can put pressure on the opposing counsel, potentially leading them to make hasty decisions.
