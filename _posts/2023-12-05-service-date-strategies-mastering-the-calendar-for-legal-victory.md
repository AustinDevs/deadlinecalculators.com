Every legal case is a battle against time. The ticking clock of court deadlines, service dates, and statutory limitations can often make or break a case. Mastering the calendar can mean the difference between victory or defeat. But, how can you turn the beast of time to your advantage?

Enter: **_Service Date Strategies._**

## What is a Service Date Strategy?

In the world of law, a service date is the day when a legal document is formally delivered to the respondent or defendant. This is a significant date as it marks the commencement of the timeline for the legal processes that follow. An effective service date strategy involves accurate tracking of these dates and subsequent deadlines, ensuring timely action and enhancing your chances of legal success.
